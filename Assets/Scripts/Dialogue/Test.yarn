    Player: Hey, Test.
    Test: Oh! Hi.
    Test: You snuck up on me.
    Test: Don't do that. 
    Test: Anyways, this is a pretty basic demonstration of how dialogue works with this library.
    Test: It's extremely customizable, so don't take anything you see here as "all you're gonna get".
    Test: From what I've learned, this library is more than capable of working for a game like this.
    Test: Currently, the setup I have going is pretty messy, so I'll try to learn more about it, and tidy things up a bit.
    Test: So, what do you think?
    -> This is pretty cool
     Test: Agreed
    -> This SUCKS
     Test: Perish.
